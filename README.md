## The idea
One of big issues of cryptocurrencies is that the results of computations they require are useless from practical perspective. It is just bunch of carfully calculated bytes without any usefull meaning. The idea is to replace these "useless" computations with usefull ones.

## The solution - PoUW (proof of usefull work)
Lets say we have a computational problem to solve and limited resources to solve it. The task would be to get as good as possible result for the problem within these limited resources. And every progress (getting better result from previous) would be gratified with "hash" coin based on proof of useful work.

## Constraints
* Currency uses real life computational problems to solve as proof of usefull work. 
* Problem should be solved within limited resources (defined for each problem separately). 
* Proper problems are those with measurable improvements as the improvement is a core of gratification.
* List of problems is expandable and each problem has to be accepted by steering committee
* Each problem is a currency "variant"


## Examples

Lets say we want a video codec and best possible image quality on limited bandwidth, limited computational cycles on "virtual machine", limited code size and limited RAM resources. Library of wisely selected videos would be a reference for measurement of image quality. Every improvement in overall quality would be gratified with "hash" of the code. As long as final result fits within limited resources the algorithm of improving would not matter (machine learning/genetic algorithms ...) and culd be a subject of "manual" earnings.

Here is an example of purely computationaly solved video codec from Nvidia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqmMnjJ6GEg
